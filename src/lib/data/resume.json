He approaches his tasks creatively, often thinking outside the box. Moreover, he sometimes comes up with additional challenges to become more familiar with the subject at matter when solving them.\n\nSecondly, it was noted that Mykola does stand out among other students in personal terms and soft skills. Not only is he adaptable with his problem solving, but he is also communicative, helpful and outgoing. He values teamwork and would often reserve his time to help others, showing both his friendliness towards other students and his leadership skills. He is hard-working, persistent and curious about material, relevant to his field of expertise outside of his work."

The result is similar to a dynamic timeline-based version of Cesium Ion or Google Earth with a small web client using limited pre-generated data and full desktop client displaying landscapes with streamed models.\nThe system uses <code>REST</code> and <code>gRPC</code> for communication through the <code>API</code>, <code>PostgreSQL</code> for temporary map data and metadata storage, <code>MongoDB</code> for 3D model, satellite image, texture, and description storage, <code>Kafka</code> for processing request querying and distribution among multiple worker <code>Software Agents</code> through a load balancer, and <code>Overpass</code> as the cartographic data source. <code>Parallel computing</code> and <code>asynchronous execution</code> is utilized where possible, database information serialization routines are generated through runtime bytecode <code>JIT-compilation</code>, and dynamic <code>SQL stored procedure generation</code> is used for query optimization. The system supports extensions through runtime plugin loading using <code>Dynamic Link Libraries</code>. <code>Kubernetes</code> are used for component container management. Monitoring, reliability, scalability and other aspects are considered. The system can be hosted independently or through AWS/Azure/Google."
