  Hi, my name's Mykola and I'm an NII intern and an ex senior software engineer at IsraelIT. As well as enterprise systems I also have experience making software and cross-platform apps. Detail-oriented, responsible and committed developer, with a get-it-done, on-time and high-quality product spirit. I quickly learn new skills and programming languages. I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>software architecture</mark> and <mark>cloud engineering</mark>.

          A highly parallel distributed system for pipeline-oriented geographic data processing.
        description: |
          The system was developed to use cloud computing to provide near real time generation of large-scale 3D models of eastern Ukraine during the full-scale russian invasion for news coverage and education purposes with a storytelling aspect. The result is similar to a dynamic timeline-based version of Cesium Ion or Google Earth with a small web client using limited pre-generated data and full desktop client displaying landscapes with streamed models. The system uses <mark>REST</mark> and <mark>gRPC</mark> for communication through the <mark>API</mark>, <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> for temporary map data and metadata storage, <mark>MongoDB</mark> for 3D model, satellite image, texture, and description storage, <mark>Kafka</mark> for processing request querying and distribution among multiple worker <mark>Software Agents</mark> through a load balancer, and <mark>Overpass</mark> as the cartographic data source. <mark>Parallel computing</mark> and <mark>asynchronous execution</mark> is utilized where possible, database information serialization routines are generated through runtime bytecode <mark>JIT-compilation</mark>, and dynamic <mark>SQL stored procedure generation</mark> is used for query optimization. The system supports extensions through runtime plugin loading using <mark>Dynamic Link Libraries</mark>. <mark>Kubernetes</mark> are used for component container management. Monitoring, reliability, scalability and other aspects are considered. The system can be hosted independently or through AWS/Azure/Google.

          A language translation / interpretation engine for cross-language compilation / execution.
        description: |
          The original idea of the project was to create a modular plugin-based framework for translating code between different programming languages. The goal was to achieve language interoperability in game engines where only a specific scripting language is supported. The project is written in <mark>.NET Standard</mark>. For now, the development was frozen due to personal time constraints and will be reworked from scratch as part of the cross game engine toolset in the future.

          A .NET GeoServer client API with minimal dependencies exclusively on standard libraries.
        description: |
          During my master's thesis project development I wanted to connect GeoServer to a PostgreSQL database during runtime, since the table and schema name wasn't known beforehand. I found out that there is no official .NET API for the server and the proposed autogenerated OpenAPI project is extremely outdated. Thus, I took it upon myself to write a proper library for <mark>GeoServer</mark> administration in <mark>.NET Standard</mark> for anyone to use. Right now the project is temporarily frozen due to lack of personal time, but it will be resumed shortly.

          A tiny, URL-friendly, unique string ID generator for C++, implementation of <a href="https://github.com/ai/nanoid">ai's nanoid</a>!
        description: |
          This <mark>C++</mark> project was developed for the purpose of providing variable-length unique identifiers for entities in custom game engines and client applications.
          
          **Can be Safe**. It uses mt19937, a strong random generator with a seed from random_device by default, which is [not cryptographically secure](https://github.com/altf4/untwister). However, the library can be expanded using an algorithm of choice (from OpenSSL, Crypto++, Botan, LibCrypto) using the [API](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/nanoid_cpp#custom-random-bytes-generator).
          
          **Compact**. It uses more symbols than UUID (`A-Za-z0-9_-`) and has the same number of unique options in just 22 symbols instead of 36.
          
          **Fast**. Nanoid is as fast as UUID but can be used in URLs.

          The thesis was written on the topic "An Extensible System for Large Scale Cultural Heritage Data Visualization". It focuses on providing a flexible, extensible, versatile, and performant architecture for big data processing. The target application for the system is large-scale 3D landscape visualization in a before/after comparison app using interactive storytelling in educational and news coverage context for the destruction in Eastern Ukraine due to the ongoing war.

          As part of the research, several scholarly publications were made and presentations at Google Japan, University of Tokyo, Yomiuri Shimbun and others were given.
