During our cooperation he has always shown strong knowledge and interest in different fields of Software Engineering. His technology bandwidth is being extended thanks to his proactive approach.\nBesides immense technical expertise, especially in such areas as Game Development, Mobile, Embedded, and Programming Languages, Mykola also has great self-organization, management, decision-making and problem-solving skills. He always performs all tasks assigned to him in a timely manner and in a good quality, looking for ways how to overcome obstacles on the implementation path.\nIt's without hesitation that I would continue working with Mykola on our projects in the future. He is a great person to collaborate with on different kinds of projects, including research ones."

We also communicated on workshops and other activities outside the main study process.\n\nFirstly, Mykola completed all of my subjects with excellent grades. He was able to reach to 5% in grades among students in his field of study. I believe he has great potential in learning new information while deepening his expertise in his area of study. He approaches his tasks creatively, often thinking outside the box. Moreover, he sometimes comes up with additional challenges to become more familiar with the subject at matter when solving them.\n\nSecondly, it was noted that Mykola does stand out among other students in personal terms and soft skills. Not only is he adaptable with his problem solving, but he is also communicative, helpful and outgoing. He values teamwork and would often reserve his time to help others, showing both his friendliness towards other students and his leadership skills. He is hard-working, persistent and curious about material, relevant to his field of expertise outside of his work."

He not only showed his personal skill during the studies, but also helped others with more complicated tasks. He also worked with others on research in the field of Electronics and Microcontrollers. His strongest soft skills are communication, teamwork, adaptability, flexibility and problem solving. During team exercises he also showed himself as a great team leader.
